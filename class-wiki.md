# Class Wikis

In your time with us you will have a Class Wiki. This wiki is your place to take notes, share helpful resources, keep track of what you've seen in class, and reference links shared by your coaches.

AND. This wiki is how you and your coaches will keep track of how far you are through the week's homework.  
* When you're having troubles you'll let us know with a :exclamation:
* When you think you're done with one level of assignment you'll let us know with a :egg:, :hatching_chick: or :hatched_chick:
* When you're working on a level of assignment you'll let us know with a :wavy_dash:
If you don't post on the wiki we'll have no way of knowing what exercises you've finished or what you're having trouble with! (we don't spend our free time checking each and every exercise, we wait for you to let us know.)

Take a look at [this example wiki](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/homework-checkoff-tables/wiki/module-0-precourse).  But wait, [what's a github wiki?](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-wikis)

Below are some example conversations between a coach and a student for you to get the idea:
