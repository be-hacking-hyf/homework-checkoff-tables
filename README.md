## Check-Off Tables

The main tool for keeping track of your homework is the _check-off table_. You will use them to track your overall progress in the class wiki and in your homework repository for feedback on individual assignments. You will be filling out a lot of these over the next 6 months. :sweat_drops:

But don't sweat too hard! These tables aren't so complicated after all. On the left side you indicate what you have finished and post any extra comments, on the right side the coach will check off your homework and leave you any extra comments

|  | your Emoji | your comments | coach emoji | coach comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [your name (links to homework)](https://www.badgerbadgerbadger.com) | :egg::hatching_chick::question: | I'm having trouble with ```const``` vs. ```var``` | :egg::hatching_chick::shipit: | :balloon: check out [this video](https://tylermcginnis.com/var-let-const/) |

(Don't panic yet!. The rest of this repo will explain in detail how to use these tables.)

## Assignment Priorities


Not all assignments are created equal.  These 3 emoji's will help you figure out how to spend your study time as effectively as possible:
* :egg: ```:egg:``` - these assignments are required, they cover the base skills you'll need to move on.
* :hatching_chick: ```:hatching_chick:``` - do your best to start these exercises. you don't need to finish or master them but getting the main idea will prepare you for success
* :hatched_chick: ```:hatched_chick:``` - Have you finished all the :egg:'s and :hatching_chick:'s? push yourself with these challenges!

Each week's homework, project, or other assignment will usually have multiple pieces.  Some are required, and others are not.  To help you, your coach and peers know how you're progressing you'll be checking off the different levels of assignment separately.

## notifications

As a coach checking over so many homeworks, it can be difficult to remember who said what and whether a comment has been addressed or not.  

For example: a student might mark their homework as finished and leave a nice comment - "I am done!".  The coach finds a mistake and leaves a note - ":exclamation:! check my PR". Coming back the next day it can be difficult to tell if the student's "I am done!" is still the old one of they have fixed the problem.

Enter: :balloon:!  Each time the student or coach leaves a new comment they will put a :balloon: in front of it.  When the student or coach has read and addressed the comment they will delete the balloon from the comment.
