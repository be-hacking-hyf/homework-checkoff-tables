# Homework Repos

For each module there is a template homework repository.  You'll fork these and complete the exercises in your fork.

In these repos will be homework tables that list all individual exercises for the week and their priorities. These tables will be used for checking off each assignment and providing more detailed feedback, while the [class wiki tables](./class-wiki.md) will be used to track your overall progress and let us know when to check your individual exercises.

Take a look at this simple example with 4 exercises - 2 required, 1 intermediate, 1 challenge.  An empty table like this will be in your homework repository when you fork it:
