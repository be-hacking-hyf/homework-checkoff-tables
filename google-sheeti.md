# Google Sheet

For each module you'll have a Google Sheet for you and your coaches to keep track of your progress with this week's homework.  
* When you're having troubles you'll let us know with a :exclamation:
* When you think you're done with the homework let us know with a :green_heart:
* When you're still working on the homework you'll let us know with a :wavy_dash:
If you don't post on the sheet we'll have no way of knowing how you're doing! (we don't spend our free time checking each and every exercise, we wait for you to let us know.)

Below are some example conversations between a coach and a student for you to get the idea:
